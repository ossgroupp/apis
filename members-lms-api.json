    "description": "**Member** is a Loyalty Management System (LMS) that enables marketers to create multiple loyalty strategies under a loyalty program to cater to various businesses and customer segments. <br> **Member overview**: <br> During onboarding, you are given the necessary **credentials** (client_id and client_secret) to obtain an access token, which is required to run every call. Membership hierarchy is organized into Programs, Clubs, and Tiers. <br> **Program** is the first hierarchy level and is where rewards and benefits are configured for the organization. <br> **Club** is the second hierarchy level and is where Rules for the program are configured. <br>Each Club must have at least one **Tier**, which is used to define membership and to configure criteria and thresholds (including free vs paid). Additional hierarchy levels can be added to support the needs of your business.  <br> Members are always enrolled into a **Default Tier** within a club. When members make purchases, they earn Points based on the rules set at the club level and/or based on promotions. When points in a member account reach a predefined **Threshold Value**, points are converted to **Rewards**. This conversion may be manual or automatic depending on the program configuration. Members can **Redeem** their rewards within the reward **Expiry Period**. Account point balances are updated after each point-impacting activity.",
